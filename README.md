**Hi 👋, I'm Anraj**

A passionate software developer and a third year double degree student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University. My previous internship was as a Web Developer & Cloud Deployment Associate at Civiconnect, where I got to work on front-end technologies and I was very lucky to be given the opportunity to work in association with the Smithsonian Institution to redesign a user friendly website for the Chavchavadze Family!
