**Hi 👋, I'm Anraj**

I'm Anraj, a fourth-year undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University. I have a passion for building meaningful software and solving difficult problems.

I’ve recently completed an internship at MDA as a Software Engineer Intern where I had the opportunity to participate in software solution designs for Canadarm2.

I have experience as a Web Development Intern at Civiconnect where I got the opportunity to work with the Smithsonian Institution on a development project for one of their historical archives. I also implemented a web development project to support business partners in digital transformation from inception through delivery.

I am currently working at AutoTrader as a data & automation intern for the Fall 2024 term!
